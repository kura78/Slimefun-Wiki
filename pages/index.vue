<h1>What is Slimefun?</h1>

<h1>What are the aims of this?</h1>
<hr>
<div class="text-box">
    A Major problem that is found with the plugin is the lack of documentation on every item. <br>
    Many items in slimefun are left unused as players do not know what to do with them.<br>
    After many hours of frustration, I have decided to make a wiki for slimefun 
    which will centralise the information about it. <br>
    Allowing players to be able to enjoy slimefun even more as they do not need to worry about <br>
    what a certain item can and cannot do e.g what ingots can't an Electric Ingot Factory make?<br>
