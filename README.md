# Slimefun Handbook

Ever needed a complex guide to every single Slimefun item? Well, then the Slimefun Handbook is for you! 

# Why create this?

Slimefun is something that I'm heavily invested in. I understand the struggle of creating an item/machine and then realising it doesn't do what I want it to do. The Handbook stops this from happening to anyone else ever again. Another reason why I made this is because of the lack of documentation on certain Addons. My goal with the Handbook is to put all the information into one small space allowing people to have access to a large amount of Slimefun data with only a click of a button.

# Contrubition 

Contributing is always welcome as this is a large project I most likely wont be able to add all information on every Slimefun item. Your GitHub username will be displayed on the page that you contribute to!

# Running Requirements

In order to run Slimefun Handbook, you need to have cloned the git repository and had ran `npm i` before running. You can start the server with `npm run dev` for development or `npm run preview` for preview. On Windows you have to run it with `npm run dev-win`, but the repository information will not work.

# Conclusion
