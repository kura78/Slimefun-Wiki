# Slimefun Handbook

Ever needed a complex guide to every single Slimefun item? Well, then the Slimefun Handbook is for you! 

# Why create this?

Slimefun is something that I'm heavily invested in. I understand the struggle of creating an item/machine and then realising it doesn't do what I want it to do. The Handbook stops this from happening to anyone else ever again. Another reason why I made this is because of the lack of documentation on certain Addons. My goal with the Handbook is to put all the information into one small space allowing people to have access to a large amount of Slimefun data with only a click of a button.

# Contrubition 

Contributing is always welcome as this is a large project I most likely wont be able to add all information on every Slimefun item. Your GitHub username will be displayed on the page that you contribute to!

# Conclusion

TBD
